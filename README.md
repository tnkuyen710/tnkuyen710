# Hey there! 🌟🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm Uyen, a curious mind with a passion for data, strategy, and tech. </br>
My journey so far? A mix of strategy, analytics, project management, and marketing across industries like automotive, finance, energy trading & commodities, retail & consumer goods, event & media publishing.

### What I work with
💻 **Tech & Tools**: Python, JavaScript, R, SQL, HTML/CSS, Power BI, Jira, Confluence, Adobe Creative Suite </br>
🌏 **Languages**: Fluent in English & Vietnamese, currently leveling up my German, Japanese, and Korean

### What I'm into
I'm all about data science, machine learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) — basically anything that turns raw data into insights that matter! 🤖 

### Where I've been
🚀 I've lived, studied, and worked in Ho Chi Minh, Tokyo, Yokohama, Oita, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Marburg, and München — constantly learning from new environments and perspectives! 🇻🇳🇯🇵🇩🇪 

### Beyond study and work...
Outside of coding and crunching numbers, you’ll find me behind a camera 📸, refining my fencing skills 🤺 , or diving into new challenges...
